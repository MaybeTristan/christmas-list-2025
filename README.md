# Christmas List 2025
### Submit bugs via this form: https://forms.gle/YYmsCVazj6CR6v529

Hello! This is a messy but functional project for my Christmas list. It's online at christmas.tristanarbet.com

Services I used:
- Google Firebase (For real time tracking to see if presents have been bought already.)
- Google Apps Script (To connect my Google Form bug reports to this repos GitHub i=Issues page.)
- GitHub Pages (To host the front end of the website.)
- Cloudflare (To link/reroute my domain to GitHub Pages site.)
- Google Forms (To create a simple bug reporting form.)
- Google Sheets (To link the form to Apps Script and GitHub, and vice versa.)
